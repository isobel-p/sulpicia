# Sulpicia 2 (Tibullus 3.14)
## Latin 
```latin
Inuisus natalis adest, qui rure molesto
    et sine Cerintho tristis agendus erit.
Dulcius urbe quid est? An uilla sit apta puellae
    atque Arretino frigidus amnis agro?
Iam, nimium Messalla mei studiose, quiescas;
    non tempestiuae saepe, propinque, uiae.
Hic animum sensusque meos abducta relinquo
    arbitrio, quamuis non sinis esse, meo.
```

```english
My hated birthday is here, in the vexsome country
and without Cerinthus sadness will be abounding.
What is sweeter than the city? And what might be suited to a girl than a villa?
Or the cold river in an Arrentine field?
Now, with Messala too much intense for me, let you be calm;
Journeys are not often in season, my kinsman.
Having been abducted, I relinquish my heart and my emotions here,
her you do not permit that she live by my judgment.

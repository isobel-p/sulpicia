# How People View Sulpicia...
Sulpicia is a very influential Roman figure, but she wasn't always seen that way. Our perspectives on her and her poetry have changed dramatically over the last two thousand years.

## ... in the Ancient World
Although Sulpicia was never mentioned in literature of the time, she could have been very well known in the literary world as she had connections like Marcus Valerius Messalla Corvinus, Emperor Augustus and Cicero. 
> Martial mentions a Sulpicia in his works *Epigrams 10.35 & 10.38*, but this is most likely another Sulpicia, who was a satirist who lived 100 years later.

## ... in Historical References
The earliest time Sulpicia was mentioned in a more modern context is in 1577. Joseph Scaliger, a 16<sup>th</sup> century scholar, was one of many who believed that Sulpicia was a persona created by Tibullus to create an original perspective on women. He called Sulpicia Tibullus' "female mouthpiece".

Later in the 18<sup>th</sup> century, Sulpicia's work started to be discussed again. Christian Gottlob Heyne, a German scholar and archeologist, became fascinated with the six poems and, in 1777, he became the first scholar to suggest that they were in fact written by a girl named Sulpicia. He attributes this to the unique femininity of the work that he believed would be hard to replicate. This view is now widespread among most scholars.

Even when she was recognised for her work, the quality of her work was criticised. Even up to the 20<sup>th</sup> century in 1966, although she was acknowledged as the author of the poems, it was believed that she needed Tibullus' support to write. One author said that he “liked to believe that Tibullus helped Sulpicia to write poetry, that he was her confidant”. Her work was seen as derivative and unskilled.

## ... in the Modern World
Today, Sulpicia is celebrated as a unique and significant voice in Roman literature, particularly as one of the few female poets whose work has survived from ancient Roman times. Modern scholars appreciate her poetry for its personal and emotional depth, offering a rare glimpse into the experiences and perspectives of women in ancient Rome. Her work is often studied for its boldness in expressing love and desire, challenging the conventions of her time.

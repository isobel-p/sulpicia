# Conclusion

In conclusion, much of Sulpicia's life has been lost to time, but what we do know from her poetry changed our understanding of women in the ancient Roman world. 

Sulpicia changed the way we perceive women in the Roman world. Having a woman write poetry was revolutionary at the time, and now it gives us an insight into normal lives for Roman women. 

Although for hundreds of years her legacy was disputed, and even today many historians believe that she was never real, Sulpicia stands as a remarkable figure in the literary tradition of ancient Rome, offering a rare and invaluable female perspective within a male-dominated world.

Sulpicia not only defied societal norms but also enriched the tradition of Roman love poetry. Future studies of her work have the potential to deepen our understanding of gender, identity, and creativity in antiquity.

## Side Note: Reed Pens

Although Sulpicia's original texts were lost, it is likely that, like many other Roman poets, she wrote on papyrus with a reed pen, like above.

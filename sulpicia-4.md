# Sulpicia 4 (Tibullus 3.16)
## Latin
```latin
Gratum est, securus multum quod iam tibi de me
    permittis, subito ne male inepta cadam.
Sit tibi cura togae potior pressumque quasillo
    scortum quam Serui filia Sulpicia:
solliciti sunt pro nobis, quibus illa dolori est
ne cedam ignoto maxima causa toro.
```
## English
```english
I am grateful that now for you, concerning me
you permit many things, immediately unconcerned lest I might topple, badly foolish.
Let care be for you of the toga I obtain and let the whore
loaded down with her wood basket be preferred to Sulpicia, daughter of Servius:
They are unconcerned for us, she whose greatest cause sorrow
is that I might not yield to an ignoble bed.
```

### Summary
Sulpicia sarcastically thanks her lover for being so confident of her love as to have an affair with a "wool-basket carrying maid" in preference to "Servius's daughter Sulpicia". She tells him that her family are anxious for her, and are very pained to see her fall for a person of low birth.

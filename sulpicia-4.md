# Sulpicia 4 (Tibullus 3.16)
## Latin
```
Gratum est, securus multum quod iam tibi de me
    permittis, subito ne male inepta cadam.
Sit tibi cura togae potior pressumque quasillo
    scortum quam Serui filia Sulpicia:
solliciti sunt pro nobis, quibus illa dolori est
ne cedam ignoto maxima causa toro.
```
## English
```
I am grateful that now for you, concerning me
you permit many things, immediately unconcerned lest I might topple, badly foolish.
Let care be for you of the toga I obtain and let the whore
loaded down with her wood basket be preferred to Sulpicia, daughter of Servius:
They are unconcerned for us, she whose greatest cause sorrow
is that I might not yield to an ignoble bed.

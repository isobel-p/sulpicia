# Sulpicia 6 (Tibullus 3.18)
## Latin
```latin
Ne tibi sim, mea lux, aeque iam feruida cura
    ac uideor paucos ante fuisse dies,
si quicquam tota commisi stulta iuuenta
    cuius me fatear paenituisse magis,
hesterna quam te solum quod nocte reliqui,
    ardorem cupiens dissimulare meum.

My light, let me not be for you now a feverish care,
as I seem to have been a few days before,
if I have committed anything in my whole stupid youth
of which I might confess to have repented of more,
than yesterday I left you, alone, at night,
wishing to conceal my adoration.

# Sulpicia 6 (Tibullus 3.18)
## Latin
```latin
Ne tibi sim, mea lux, aeque iam feruida cura
    ac uideor paucos ante fuisse dies,
si quicquam tota commisi stulta iuuenta
    cuius me fatear paenituisse magis,
hesterna quam te solum quod nocte reliqui,
    ardorem cupiens dissimulare meum.
```
## English
```english
My light, let me not be for you now a feverish care,
as I seem to have been a few days before,
if I have committed anything in my whole stupid youth
of which I might confess to have repented of more,
than yesterday I left you, alone, at night,
wishing to conceal my adoration.
```

### Summary
Sulpicia tells her lover that she has never done anything so foolish as she did the previous night when she refused to sleep with him for fear of making her love to him too obvious.

# Sulpicia 1 (Tibullus 3.13)
## Latin
```
Tandem uenit amor, qualem texisse pudori
    quam nudasse alicui sit mihi fama magis.
Exorata meis illum Cytherea Camenis
    attulit in nostrum deposuitque sinum.
Exsoluit promissa Venus: mea gaudia narret,
    dicetur si quis non habuisse sua.
Non ego signatis quicquam mandare tabellis,
    ne legat id nemo quam meus ante, uelim,
sed peccasse iuuat, uultus componere famae
    taedet: cum digno digna fuisse ferar.
```

## English
```
Finally love came, and the rumour that I had
concealed would cause greater shame than if I had laid it bare.
Having been persuaded, Venus brought him to my poetry
and laid him in my lap.
Venus let loose these promises: if anyone tells of my joy,
it is decreed that I have not had it.
I do not demand anything with sealed letters,
lest no one read it before than my own, I would wish,
but he delights to have done wrong, to compose the appearance of a rumour
he tires me: let it be said that when I am with someone worthy I am worthy.

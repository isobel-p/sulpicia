## Early Life

Little is known about Sulpicia's life, as most of her life was unrecorded. What we know comes from her poetry and references to her work. She was likely born into a wealthy and prominent family in Rome, as her poetry reflects a level of education and literary sophistication that suggests she had access to the cultural and intellectual resources of her time.

## Background
Sulpicia lived during the late Roman Republic (late 1st century BCE). During this time there was political turmoil in Rome. The Republic was facing internal conflicts that would eventually lead to its transformation into the Roman Empire. There were also civil wars, and the rise and assassination of Caesar.

Despite the political instability, this period was also a time of cultural flourishing, with advancements in literature, art, and philosophy. Sulpicia's poetry was probably written in a time of exciting new literature from new authors.

## Poetry
Most poets from this era were from wealthy families and wrote poetry in their leisure time, as they were better educated and did not have to work as much. It is assumed that Sulpicia also belonged to a wealthy family, as said above.

Sulpicia is believed to have died around 20 BCE. It is not known how she died.

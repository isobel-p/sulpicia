# Sulpicia 3 (Tibullus 3.15)
## Latin
```
Scis iter ex animo sublatum triste puellae?
    Natali Romae iam licet esse tuo.
Omnibus ille dies nobis natalis agatur,
    qui nec opinanti nunc tibi forte uenit.
```
## English
```
You know the journey from the heart has been carried to your sad girl?
Now is permitted for her to be in Rome on your birthday.
Let us all celebrate that day of birth,
which by chance is coming, not imagined by you now.

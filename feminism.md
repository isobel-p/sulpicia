# Sulpicia on Women in the Ancient World
Because Sulpicia's poetry is the only evidence we have of female poetry in Roman times, it offers a unique perspective on the lives on women in ancient Rome. 

## Perspectives

Sulpicia's elegies were seen as emotionally honest, as an accurate portrayal of a woman's life by a woman. Although her work is now being recognised for its technical skill and expressive descriptions, the most important quality of the poems' content is what it tells us about a woman’s life at this time.

Sulpicia’s poems are often looked at as a metaphor for the female body, where readers experience the femininity first hand upon reading her poems, rather than the physical descriptions of female bodies offered by her male counterparts. This unique perspective on feminism helped to contribute to the idea that Sulpicia was a real woman who wrote her own poems, [instead of a man writing from a woman's perspective](/views.md), because this idea was very different than what other male Roman poets wrote about.

## Evidence

The six elegies focus mainly on Sulpicia's romantic feelings and experiences. She shows her readers the complexities of relationships in a very patriarchal society. Her interactions with Cerinthus can tell us about how women were treated and seen in Roman times. She explores her emotions in great depth, which challenges the traditional potrayal of women as passive objects subservient to men. Her honest exploration of love proves that women had their own feelings.

Sulpicia's work highlights the social expectations placed on women. She feels frustration at the imbalance between her and Cerinthus. She shows the struggles faced by women in love and relationships and subtly criticises the gender norms of her time. 

## Criticisms

Some critics say that because her elegies are so short, it offers us a limited insight into Roman women. Because Sulpicia was presumably quite wealthy, her perspective does not reflect the lives of every single Roman woman. However, it does tell us a lot about the lives of the average ancient Roman woman, at least more so than the ordinary male-dominated poetry. Her brief insights were likely more honest and realistic than the interpretations of male poets.
